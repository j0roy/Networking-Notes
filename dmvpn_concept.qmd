# DMVPN Concept

Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN) feature combines GRE tunnels, IPsec encryption, and NHRP routing.\
[Source cisco.com](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_conn_dmvpn/configuration/15-mt/sec-conn-dmvpn-15-mt-book/sec-conn-dmvpn-dmvpn.html) Three phase exist and each of them add functionnality to the last phase. Similar to version.

# DMVPN Phase 1

Designed for Hub and Spoke communications only.\
- Spokes talk to each other through the hub.\

# DMVPN Phase 2

-   Spoke to Spoke communications are now working since they are using mGRE tunnel.\
    mGRE everywhere.\
    Next-hop point to spoke instead of hub.\

# DMVPN Phase 3

-   Ability to add explicit route summarization(large deployment,Send summary route instead of thousand of spoke route)
-   Support multi-tiers design
-   Hub can now redirect flow.Tell the spoke about a better path via nhrp
-   Spoke can now use shortcut: NHRP is allowed to overwrite CEF.

# DMVPN HUB Configuration Phase 1 No IPSEC
Production environment use VRF.This configuration doesn't include them.\
