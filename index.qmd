# About me

I am a Network consultant based in QC,Canada and I work mostly with Cisco gear in the enterprise LAN and DC space.\
Aside from route/switch, firewall security is the third fields that I'm being more attracted to, which will probably be my next cert.\
I often find myself using automation tool/scripting to make my life/work easier, which I enjoy a lot.

# Purpose of the site

This website serves as a technical networking blog.  
You will find information related to the topics that appear in Cisco certification blueprints and a little bit more.
