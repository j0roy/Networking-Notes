# IPv4 Access Control Lists

access control list (ACL)\
access control entries (ACE)

Standard ACL 1-99, 1300-1999\
Only match on source.

Extended ACL 100-199, 2000-2699.\
Match on source, destination, protocol and more ...

Numbered ACLs,add sequence automatically

```         
access-list 1 permit 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255
access-list 1 permit 172.17.0.0 0.0.255.255
```

Named ACLs

```         
ip access-list extended FTP-port
 permit tcp 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 any eq ftp
```

```         
interface gi 0/0
ip access-group FTP-port in


show ip interaface gig 0/0
outgoing access list is list111
Inbound access list is FTP-port
```

ACL don't block router generated traffic.\
Be careful if you assign an ACL that is not already created. Has soon you add one ACE in it. The ACL will because active and might block undesirable traffic.
