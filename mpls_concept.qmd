# MPLS Concept

MPLS is a packet-forwarding technology which uses labels in order to make data forwarding decisions.\
The label is imposed between the data link layer (Layer 2) header and network layer (Layer 3) header.

Customer(C): IP-only routers internal to customer network Customer Edge(CE): C routers which face PE routers Provider Edge(PE): LSRs on the MPLS-IP boundary Provider(P: MPLS-only LSRs in provider network

Label Distribution Protocol(LDP): protocol that automatically generates and exchanges labels between routers. Label Switching Router(LSR): Any router performing label switching (MPLS).\
Label-Switched Path(LSP):\
Label Information Base (LIB): Contains all labels learned by an LSR via a label distribution protocol. Forwarding Information Base(FIB): Routing database for unlabeled (IP) packets\
Label FIB (LFIB): Routing database for labeled (MPLS) packets

Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP): The second-to-last LSR in an LSP removes the MPLS label so the last LSR only has to perform an IP lookup
