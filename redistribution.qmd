Redistribution OSPF
Ne pas oublier d'ajouter le mot clé subnet 



prevent routing loop via redistribution via tagging and change AD


Default redistribution metric:
Set globaly in the routing protocol
set via the redistribution command
Set via a route map



General Notes
Routers doing mutual redistribution will not readvertise routes between protocols (Ex: EIGRP > OSPF > EIGRP)
Routes will not be redistributed if they don’t exist in the RIB
Not possible to create loops with a single redistribution point
EIGRP and OSPF will not accept routes advertised from their own router ID for loop prevention
Tags can be used to prevent loops caused by advertising routes from one domain back into the same domain
Modifying AD can prevent loops caused by higher AD protocols being redistributed into lower AD protocols and then preferred through that protocol
Normally applied with route-map to advertise specific routes, set tags, etc
Redistribution per Protocol
EIGRP
Redistribution into EIGRP can be done anywhere in the topology
Redistributed routes are marked external, AD of 170
When redistributing into EIGRP, must assign metric either directly or with the default-metric command
OSPF
Redistribution can happen anywhere aside from stubby, totally stubby networks - redistributing router becomes ASBR and has type 4 LSA advertised to any areas outside of its own local area to ensure reachability to border router
External routes will be LSA 5 in regular area, LSA 7 in NSSA and translated to type 5 at ABR
By default routes will be external type 2, e1 always preferred over e2 in OSPF algorithm
Must use the subnets flag or only classful routes will be redistributed
BGP
Redistribution from BGP can be dangerous if using eBGP as IGPs will not be able to handle a full BGP table
Must manually match externals if redistributing OSPF, otherwise only internal routes redistributed
Useful show commands
ip route profile - Shows changes in routing topology, useful to see route flapping

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
