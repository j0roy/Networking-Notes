#Unicast reverse path forwarding

Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (URPF) is a mechanism for validating the source IP address of packets received on a router.

A router configured with URPF performs a reverse path lookup in the FIB table to validate the presence of the source IP address.

CEF (Cisco Express Forwarding) must be enabled on the IOS device for uRPF to work.\
uRPF can operate in two modes: loose, strict.

-   Loose: The router verifies the <u>source</u> IP can be reached via the routing table using any interface (other than a default route).
-   Strict : The router verifies the <u>source</u> of the IP packet <u>arrives on the same interface the router would use to reach that source address</u> . Cause problem with asymmetric routing.

```  
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip verify unicast source reachable-via any ###Loose
ip verify unicast source reachable-via rx  ### Strict
```
